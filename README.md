* Brief Description
Blind, the dictionary defines it in one simple word, sightless. The life for a visually challenged person is extremely hard for obvious reasons. In this era of cutting-edge technology, it is still extremely difficult for visually challenged people to carry out day to day chores or enjoy the simple pleasures of life such as going for a walk, socializing, and so on. Hence, developing new solutions that allow those individuals to interact with sighted people, and the sighted world, in a way that lessens any of the problems that can arise from being visually impaired is becoming increasingly important. This paper presents a Smart Device built using a Raspberry Pi that can be controlled via Voice Commands and carry out various tasks such as Object Detection, Navigation, and notify the user through Haptic and Audio feedback. The device will also take help of Image Recognition and Image Processing in order to convey information about specific places to the user as soon as the user is in that particular vicinity, hence allowing the person using the device know their surrounding environment in a better way.
